Project Write Up for Nice Paper by Adam M, Adam N, and Ken K:


Nice Paper is an app for wedding couples to create, edit, and publish
a paperless wedding ceremony program.  Nice Paper allows a wedding couple
to register with the site, generate a unique schedule for their big day,
then make a guest username and password to share with their guests and vendors.
Nice Paper reduces printing and paper costs for a couple, gives them an aesthetic,
easy to use interface that is mobile first, allows schedule updating on the fly,
and lets a couple to save money to use on other parts of their wedding.

The technologies we used were: javascript, jquery, ajax, knex, html, ejs, css with Boostrap,
psql, node, jwt, bcrypt, heroku, and a lot of human sweat, brain power, and sacrificed sleep.
We used an agile workflow methodology via waffle.io, and a github multi-branch workflow
with three developers having equal access to a single master branch.
